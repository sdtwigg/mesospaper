\subsection{Experimental Setup}
Unfortunately, we did not have access to a large cluster to run Mesos on. We instead ran our
experimentation on 8-core 2.67 GHz Intel Xeon processor with 49 GB of usable memory. In all of our
experiments, we used 1 instance of a Mesos Master managing 1 Slave in charge of a 8 slot ``cluster''.
Due to compute resource limitations, the experimental setup is not meant to be representative of a real
Mesos cluster. However, since we designed our synthetic frameworks to highlight specific problem 
scenarios in a Mesos cluster and not for big-picture catch-all experiments, the experimental results
are still highly beneficial.

\subsection{Offer Revocation}
Something something offer revocation.

\subsection{Resource Revocation}
We examined two extreme corners of operation.
